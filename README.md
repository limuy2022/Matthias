# Matthias
A decentralized chat application built completely in rust.
## Features
- Encrypted messages ensuring security
- Decentralized backend which doesnt rely on any central provider
- Customizable profiles
- Text, audio, image, file messages furthermore images are also displayed
- Voice call
- Exrtensive lua (using luajit) API with documentation at [Gitbook](https://matthias.gitbook.io/) with external libs available
- Custom connection urls (If the app is installed through the installer) this allows the user to connect to a server with just a link 
- Custom emojies
- Windows installer (Using a Visual Studio project)
- Intuitive user interface
- Experimental MD (Markdown) support

__All this__ with great preformance, due to the project being mulit-threaded, using async calls with egui and many more!
I have also tried to make my codebase futureproof, with implementing custom automatizations (Example: code generating for emojies) and custom proc macros.
