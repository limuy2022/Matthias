# Independent chat application with encryption, made from scratch

### This chat app features aes-256 encryption, and argon2 password hashing.
### You can send files, images, voice recordings and many more!
### It also has a small amount of markdown support. (Im going to improve on this later)
### It features almost everything a major messaging platform has. (eg. Editing messages, reacting to messages, etc.)
### With Version 5 an Api is also available for scripting purposes.
