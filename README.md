### This rust app features aes-256 encryption, and argon2 password hashing algorithms.
## You can send files, images, voice recordings and many more!
## It also has a small amount of markdown support. (Im going to improve on this later)
## It features almost everything a major messaging platform has. (eg. Editing messages, reacting to messages, etc.)
