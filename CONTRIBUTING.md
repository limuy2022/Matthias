# Contributing
## How to create a good pull request:
- Make sure to describe what you are fixing / contributing and how. You should also include what the problem was with the current code you're replaceing (if any).
- Make sure to write clean code, with comments so that anyone can easily understand what you have written in the future.
## External documentation:
- When dealing with something which has external documentation, make sure to share the source.
## Community standards:
- You should always be polite and patient with one another, as everyone can make mistakes.
## Branch commits:
- When dealing with another branch please try to make descriptive commit messages, so the commits and their code included can be easily traced and tracked, this also makes finishing pull requests easier.
